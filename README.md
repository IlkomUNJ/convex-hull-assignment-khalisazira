# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  

AI were used to analyze errors and integrate the algorithm accurately.  
AI used: Gemini

Queries used: 
"I'm getting this error: 'invalid operands to binary expression... (const QPoint' and 'const QPoint')' what code do I need to fix it?"
"I'm getting an 'unknown type name' error for a class I defined; what's the correct way to forward-declare a class header in Qt C++?"
"How do I fix the multiple definition linker errors when defining a custom static inline comparison function directly within a C++ header file?"
"How to call both the slow convex hull and convex hull functions when the 'Fix Convex Hull' button is pressed in Qt, and then display both iteration counts?"
"How can I use QPainter to write two separate iteration counts (for slow and fast algorithms) onto my DrawingCanvas?"


# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

I asked Nazwa Aiana Putri whether i needed 2 buttons for the algorithm or just one.

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
